<p>Mysore classes are a type of Ashtanga yoga class. This style of class is modeled after the Ashtanga yoga classes in Mysore, India as taught by the late Sri K. Pattabhi Jois. The  classes are not led. Students work independently (with guidance from the teacher) on the particular series of postures that is most appropriate for them.</p>

<p>The teacher works closely with new students to help them learn the postures and sequencing. We also have practice cards (‘cheat sheets’) to help students learn the sequencing of postures. </p>

<p>The Mysore class setting allows each student to work at his or her own pace. It also helps students to develop a self-practice, which is an integral part of the Ashtanga system.  </p>

<p>Classes are open for 2 hours, but students may come and go anytime during that time frame, depending on what fits their personal practice and their schedule. Mysore classes are open to students of all levels.</p>
