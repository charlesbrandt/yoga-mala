<p>The term Hatha Yoga includes all physical forms of yoga. Hatha yoga is often an entry point for approaching the more spiritual and philosophical aspects of yoga. Over the centuries many different schools of hatha yoga have been developed to help students on their paths towards enlightenment.
In this class, the teacher starts with an intention and then draws from the different schools of hatha yoga that she has studied to build a balanced sequence grounded in that intention. Each class is designed to helps the students open up to the more subtle and internal facets of yoga.</p>
