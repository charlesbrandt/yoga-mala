<p>“Health is wealth. Peace of mind is happiness. Yoga shows the way.” ~ Swami Vishnudevanada<br><br>
Sivananda yoga is based on classical hatha and follows a set sequence of pranayama (breathing exercises), sun salutations, 12 asanas (yoga postures), a guided relaxation, and savasana. Concentration is placed on coordinating the breath with movement and postures are held longer, allowing the body to sink deeper into each pose. Students rest in savasana after every section of the class, creating a balance between work and rest, and enabling the body to reap the full benefits of the practice. As a result, the body, mind, and spirit are energetically balanced and relaxed. </p>
