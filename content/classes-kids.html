<h3>Kids Yoga (ages 3 â€“ 5 years)</h3>

<p>Our Kids Yoga classes are designed to be engaging and fun as well as to introduce pre-school aged children to the mental and physical benefits of yoga. Each class will be centered around a theme (an animal, a season, etc.) and will include crafts, games, teamwork, and music as well as yoga postures and breathing techniques to help students develop body awareness, calming techniques and a sense of wellbeing.</p>

<p>Our Kids Yoga teacher, Heather, has a Bachelor of Arts in early education, taught pre-school for many years and has been teaching yoga to adults since 2015. She is delighted to bring her two passions (children and yoga) together in her Kids Yoga classes.</p>
