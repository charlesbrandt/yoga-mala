  <h3>Kids Yoga (children ages 7 -12)</h3>
  <p>Class begins with gathering time and theme discussion followed by mindfulness practices, such as mindful listening and breath-work, such as diaphragmatic breathing and anchor breath. The classes continue with a  thorough warm up and Sun Salutations before moving into more challenging asanas. Class includes a mixture of standing and seated poses, forward and backward bends, side bends, twists, and inversions.</p>
  <p>Participants will have a chance to create their own sequence of poses and share it with the class, taking turns leading if they choose. Lastly, weâ€™ll wind down with relaxation to gentle music and guided imagery, surrounding ourselves with positivity and kindness.</p>
