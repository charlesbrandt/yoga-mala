<p><font size=5><u><b><a id="ashtanga">Ashtanga Yoga:</a></b></u></font></p>
<p>Ashtanga Yoga classes are dynamic, precise and rigorous, using specific
postures, breathing techniques and meditation to develop the mind and
body. The sequence of postures in each series is set, allowing for a
progressive and balanced releasing in the body.  Each series has specific focal
points. <u><b>The Primary Series</b></u>
focuses on forward bends, releasing the back and legs. The postures
are therapeutic and help us to release the past. 

  <u><b>The Secondary Series</b></u>
      focuses on back-bending and spinal twisting. These postures energize
      the nervous system and open us to the future.
