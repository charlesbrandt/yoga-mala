<p>Iyengar yoga, named after BKS Iyengar, encompasses union of mind, body, and spirit through asana, pranayama, and self-study practices. BKS Iyengar is a true inspiration because he never gave up on life. He started doing yoga because of his detrimental health struggles as a child and continued to better himself with unwavering dedication. 
</p>

<p>BKS Iyengar made yoga approachable for people of any age with any body type, and for people with health challenges or injuries. His lineage is a gift, a journey of growth that encompasses keen attention, curiosity, joy, acceptance, surrender, and dedication. Iyengar Yoga is a learning path that nurtures positive growth and transformation. </p>

<p>Through asana and breath- bones, muscles, and joints come into alignment -bringing rejuvenation and energy. Asana practice nourishes the organs and tissues of the body by detoxifying the blood and improving circulation throughout the system. Postures are refined not only to encourage safe healing, but so the mind focuses, the consciousness opens, and the emotions lift.</p>
