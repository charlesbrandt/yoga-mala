<p>The Feldenkrais Method uses gentle movement, mindfulness, and attention to your own body sensations to create the possibility for more comfortable and efficient movement. It gives students the opportunity to explore their patterns and expand their possibilities related to movement, thought, emotion, and kinesthetic sense. Students often find that Feldenkrais classes help them decrease pain; find more ease and vitality in everyday activities; improve strength and flexibility; and enhance creativity and thinking. It is used by musicians, dancers, actors, athletes, seniors, and average people. Feldenkrais classes are accessible for all ability levels. If you are unable to get up the stairs to the yoga studio or have trouble lying on the floor, email Alex at <a href="mailto:alex.toenniges@gmail.com">alex.toenniges@gmail.com</a> for accommodations.
