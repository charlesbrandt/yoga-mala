    Alex discovered the Feldenkrais Method in 2013 through her musical training. She was initially struck by how much of a difference it made in her ability to deal with the stresses and anxieties of school. She began to feel surer of herself and learned how to use less effort to accomplish more. Since then, Feldenkrais has influenced every facet of her life. <br>

    Alex's teaching helps students to find more ease and vitality; reduce pain; find more creativity and clarity of thinking; have a better sense of self and empowerment; and feel more connected to others while finding clearer boundaries.

    Debby has been teaching Ashtanga Yoga in Bloomington since
    2002. She enjoys helping students develop a practice that is graceful and
    fluid, balancing effort and ease.  Debby loves Ashtanga Yoga because of the
    ways in which the physical  practice helps her gain a deeper and more
    personal understanding of the philosophical and spiritual branches of yoga.

Heather remembers well what it feels like to start attending yoga classes as she was recently a beginner herself. She enjoys practicing and teaching Ashtanga Yoga because of the way it helps balance her physical, mental, and emotional well being. Heather hopes that her classes will help beginning students to calm their mind, improve their flexibility and strength, and to find the beginnings of the path to inner peace.

    Kalika began teaching yoga in 2006 as a full-time volunteer at Shoshoni Yoga Retreat  in Rollinsville, Colorado. She spent several years at Shoshoni, home of the Shambhava School of Yoga, studying yoga and meditation and learning to live and breathe a yogic lifestyle. She fell in love with the practice of Bhakti yoga while singing in Shoshoni’s resident band, Shiva’s Garden and continues to share this musical form of yoga in classes and workshops. <br>
    Kalika’s yoga classes integrate gentle breath awareness techniques with a nourishing flow of postures. Sequences are designed to stretch and strengthen the body while maintaining a meditative focus. Students are encouraged to honor their bodies and find the most supportive expression of each posture.<br>

    Lazriel began taking yoga classes in 2002 after a very serious automobile accident that left him with severe back and neck pain. He learned that yoga was not only a means to heal himself but also a path of empowerment to gain control over his life.  Lazriel first studied yoga with the Art of Living and Sri Sri Ravi Shankar. He later studied yoga and yoga therapy at the Amrit Yoga Institute. As a teacher, Lazriel loves to merge the healing power of yogic techniques with modern day understandings to bring a practical ‘real world’ approach to yoga.

    </div>

    Nancy came to teaching yoga after many years of practice and study that began in a time when yoga teachers and classes were few and far between. She honors many luminous teachers who have generously shared their knowledge and practice with her since then, as well as citing her students as valued teachers. She received her teacher training and certification at the White Lotus Foundation in Santa Barbara, California. <br>
    <br>

    Nancy’s classes are offered in the vinyasa style, linking postures through breath and movement. She encourages students to become attuned to their own deeper instincts and to practice accordingly. She values the sense of wholeness that results from practicing yoga, as well as the development of strength, flexibility, grace and ease. It is Nancy’s wish that students at Yoga Mala will find support and guidance for evolving a yoga practice that is sustainable and sustaining throughout their lives.

    Steph has been teaching in Bloomington since 2009.  Drawn to the ways in which yoga helped her to remain open to the changes in her life and others around her, she began a daily yoga practice over ten years ago.  She has since trained in alignment-based vinyasa yoga.  Steph’s approach to yoga strives to balance an aligned physical foundation with the freedom of an open heart.  This approach encourages fuller awareness of the body, as a path toward cultivating strength, flexibility, and inquiry into life and spirit.  Steph is grateful to her teachers and her community, and for the opportunity to share this practice with others.

    Virginia has been teaching yoga in Bloomington since 2012. First drawn to yoga by the physicality of the Vinyasa and Ashtanga practices, she slowly discovered the philosophy behind the practice and something shifted inside.<br>
    <br>
    
    Virginia believes in the need for balance between a Vinyasa and a Yin practice. With the passive postures of Yin Yoga, you will be asked to relax and soften, entering a state of meditation and surrender. In her Vinyasa classes, you will be challenged to trust the process and let go of the results, flowing between poses to create a moving meditation.
