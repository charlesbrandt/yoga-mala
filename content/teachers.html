    Cinnamon was born in the Amazon and raised in the Andean Mountains of Bolivia. Throughout her life she has been drawn to practices that involve movement and the expression of the soul through that movement. On a visit to Bloomington in 2014, she discovered yoga and it immediately resonated with her. She immersed herself in yoga both here and back home in South America - eventually teaching as well as practicing yoga.  In her classes Cinnamon creates a space that encourages students to explore their inner world and to discover the deeper truths that yoga practice and self-inquiry can illuminate.

    Debby has been teaching Ashtanga Yoga in Bloomington since
    2002. She enjoys helping students develop a practice that is graceful and
    fluid, balancing effort and ease.  Debby loves Ashtanga Yoga because of the
    ways in which the physical  practice helps her gain a deeper and more
    personal understanding of the philosophical and spiritual branches of yoga.

    Eryn recently returned to Bloomington after spending 3 years in NYC where she taught and practiced yoga. Her intention in teaching is to provide students with a safe and approachable practice. She hopes to challenge them in a way that feels relevant to their daily lives and has the potential to broaden their perspective or flip their viewpoint.  She teaches from a kinesthetic perspective and promotes proper alignment to facilitate easier flow of energy and breath. Through pranayama and physical asana, she intends to give students the opportunity to explore the power of their foundation and the ability to expand beyond their perceived limitations. <br>

Heather remembers well what it feels like to start attending yoga classes as she was recently a beginner herself. She enjoys practicing and teaching Ashtanga Yoga because of the way it helps balance her physical, mental, and emotional well being. Heather hopes that her classes will help beginning students to calm their mind, improve their flexibility and strength, and to find the beginnings of the path to inner peace.

    Kalika began teaching yoga in 2006 as a full-time volunteer at Shoshoni Yoga Retreat  in Rollinsville, Colorado. She spent several years at Shoshoni, home of the Shambhava School of Yoga, studying yoga and meditation and learning to live and breathe a yogic lifestyle.

    <br>
    Kalika’s yoga classes integrate gentle breath awareness techniques with a nourishing flow of postures.

    </div>

    Nancy came to teaching yoga after many years of practice and study that began in a time when yoga teachers and classes were few and far between. She honors many luminous teachers who have generously shared their knowledge and practice with her since then, as well as citing her students as valued teachers. She received her teacher training and certification at the White Lotus Foundation in Santa Barbara, California. <br>
    <br>

    Nancy’s classes are offered in the vinyasa style, linking postures through breath and movement. She encourages students to become attuned to their own deeper instincts and to practice accordingly. She values the sense of wholeness that results from practicing yoga, as well as the development of strength, flexibility, grace and ease. It is Nancy’s wish that students at Yoga Mala will find support and guidance for evolving a yoga practice that is sustainable and sustaining throughout their lives.

    Steph has been teaching in Bloomington since 2009.  Drawn to the ways in which yoga helped her to remain open to the changes in her life and others around her, she began a daily yoga practice over ten years ago.  She has since trained in alignment-based vinyasa yoga.  Steph’s approach to yoga strives to balance an aligned physical foundation with the freedom of an open heart.  This approach encourages fuller awareness of the body, as a path toward cultivating strength, flexibility, and inquiry into life and spirit.  Steph is grateful to her teachers and her community, and for the opportunity to share this practice with others.
