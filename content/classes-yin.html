<p>The gentle yoga class is specifically designed for beginners andÂ students with limited mobility, and focuses above all on safety and respect for students' individual needs. It seeks to enable a wide range of students to experience the benefits of yoga, which include pain relief, improved circulation, strength, mobility, relaxation, and mental focus. Students will learn how to build strength and flexibility while protecting the spine and joints, and how to deepen awareness of their own bodies. Chairs will be provided to those who need them. Please note that the studio is currently accessible only via stairs. If you are unable to attend for this reason, please contact us about the possibility of arranging alternatives. </p>

<p>Yin Yoga classes apply a calming and restorative approach to yoga asana practice. These classes move slowly, using long, meditative holds to help release physical and mental stress. Props are used to keep students safe and to adapt each posture to the individual needs of the student. Postures are held for several minutes to allow students to ease into deep relaxation. This class is appropriate for all levels.</p>
