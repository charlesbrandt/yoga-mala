<p>Sangha meditation is an opportunity for experienced meditators to practice twice per month with other meditators. Meetings will be 8:30 - 9:30 am on the 1st and 3rd Fridays of each month at Yoga Mala. Meetings begin with 30 minutes of silent sitting practice followed by a brief reading and a period of sharing from personal experience of the reading.</p>

<p>Practitioners are invited to arrive a few minutes early to allow time for settling into stillness. We will observe silence upon entering the studio. Hot tea will be available after the bell following sitting practice. Silence will be maintained until after the reading.</p>

<p><font size=5><u><b><a id="gong_meditation">Gong Meditation:</a></b></u></font></p>

<p>Gong class is your time to relax and simply be. Class begins with light stretching and breathing exercises followed by shavasana (lying down) for the remainder of class. The gong is a very powerful tool for healing; stress relief; deep relaxation; meditation and spiritual growth. The gong takes you out of ordinary everyday five-sense reality into the expanded consciousness of the right brain, where extraordinary things can happen. Stresses are removed and life force energy is revived and rejuvenated. In this class you will enter a cocoon of gong sound and experience the beautiful and varied effects of this ancient spiritual tool. </p>
