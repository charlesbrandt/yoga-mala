<p><font size=5><u><b><a id="nada">Morning Meditation and Nāda Yoga (chanting)</a></b></u></font></p>

<p>Morning meditation and chanting is a 30-minute session, consisting of 20 minutes of meditation, bookended by approximately 5 minutes of chanting.  Chanting time will be used to learn (as needed) and practice various chants, experiencing the acoustic and vibratory nature of Nāda Yoga, or the Yoga of Sound. Chanting is an excellent way to begin and end any yogic practice.  The 20-minute meditation period will be undertaken in silence, and will primarily follow the Soto Zen style, in that each person will sit facing the wall, with backs to the room.  Apart from that, each person is free to practice whichever style of meditation they choose, as long as it is done in silence.  </p>
<p>Practitioners should try to arrive 5-10 minutes early to establish your place and get settled prior to starting.  Dress comfortably.  Meditation cushions and other supports for sitting are available for use, or you may bring your own items.    Anyone needing guidance for meditation techniques or wanting an orientation to the session, please contact the facilitator (Mike Sauer) at mikesauer1@gmail.com to arrange a meeting at 7am, prior to your first session. </p>

<p>There is no cost for attending these meditation sessions.</p>

<p>Sangha meditation is an opportunity for experienced meditators to practice twice per month with other meditators. Meetings will be 8:30 - 9:30 am on the 1st and 3rd Fridays of each month at Yoga Mala. Meetings begin with 30 minutes of silent sitting practice followed by a brief reading and a period of sharing from personal experience of the reading.</p>

<p>Practitioners are invited to arrive a few minutes early to allow time for settling into stillness. We will observe silence upon entering the studio. Hot tea will be available after the bell following sitting practice. Silence will be maintained until after the reading.</p>
