<p>Prerequisite: 6 months of yoga experience with any method.</p>

<p>This class will focus on breathing techniques to restore inner harmony and to promote the release of tension throughout the body and mind. Classes will start with a few chest openers to prepare the lungs for pranayama breathing practices. Students will learn proper alignment for pranayama in order to keep the nervous system relaxed. Through pranayama practice, muscle soreness can be reduced, emotions soothed and the body detoxified. Students are encouraged to develop a daily home practice so that the maximum benefits of pranayama can be experienced.</p>

<p>Sangha meditation is an opportunity for experienced meditators to practice twice per month with other meditators. Meetings will be 8:30 - 9:30 am on the 1st and 3rd Fridays of each month at Yoga Mala. Meetings begin with 30 minutes of silent sitting practice followed by a brief reading and a period of sharing from personal experience of the reading.</p>

<p>Practitioners are invited to arrive a few minutes early to allow time for settling into stillness. We will observe silence upon entering the studio. Hot tea will be available after the bell following sitting practice. Silence will be maintained until after the reading.</p>
