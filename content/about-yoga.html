<h1 align=center><sub><u>About Yoga</u></sub></h1>

<p>Yoga has evolved over 1000s of years to help individuals foster  moral,
physical, mental, emotional and spiritual development. It offers
guidance for exploring the nature of consciousness and for 
integrating mind, body and spirit. Yoga helps its practitioners on
their paths towards mental clarity, open-heartedness, a state of
peace and joy, and enlightenment.</p>


<p>Yoga is rooted in the Hindu tradition and <u><b>The
Upanishads</b></u> and <u><b>The Bhagavad Gita</b></u> 
are considered to be the spiritual and philosophical foundations of
yoga.  <u><b>The Yoga Sutras of Pantanjali</b></u>
 offers a systematized explanation of the ideas and
practices of yoga and is the basis for yoga as we know it today.</p>


<p>Yoga has many contemporary manifestations, each with its own emphases. 
This provides students with the opportunity to explore different
approaches and to find a school of yoga where they feel at home and
most able to grow.</p>
