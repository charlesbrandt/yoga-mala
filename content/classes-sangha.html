<p>Sangha meditation is an opportunity for experienced meditators to practice twice per month with other meditators. Meetings will be 8:30 - 9:30 am on the 1st and 3rd Fridays of each month at Yoga Mala. Meetings begin with 30 minutes of silent sitting practice followed by a brief reading and a period of sharing from personal experience of the reading.</p>

<p>Practitioners are invited to arrive a few minutes early to allow time for settling into stillness. We will observe silence upon entering the studio. Hot tea will be available after the bell following sitting practice. Silence will be maintained until after the reading.</p>
