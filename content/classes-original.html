    <p><font size=5><u><b><a id="ashtanga">Ashtanga Yoga Classes:</a></b></u></font></p>
    <p>Ashtanga Yoga classes are dynamic, precise and rigorous, using specific
postures, breathing techniques and meditation to develop the mind and
body. The sequence of postures in each series is set, allowing for a
progressive and balanced releasing in the body.  Each series has specific focal
points. <u><b>The Primary Series</b></u>
focuses on forward bends, releasing the back and legs. The postures
are therapeutic and help us to release the past. 
      <u><b>The Secondary Series</b></u>
      focuses on back-bending and spinal twisting. These postures energize
      the nervous system and open us to the future.

      <li class="ashtanga"><div><span class="ashtanga-title"><a id="ashtanga_basics">Ashtanga Basics</a> </span><sup class="level">(level 1)</sup></div>
The Ashtanga Basics classes focus on the fundamental postures of Ashtanga Yoga – sun salutations, basic standing and seated poses and elements of the finishing sequence. Students learn to move safely and mindfully through the postures, using their breath to focus and guide their practice. These classes are appropriate for complete beginners as well as for more experienced students. (1 hour) </li>

      <li class="ashtanga"><div><span class="ashtanga-title"><a id="ashtanga_primary_series_level2">Ashtanga Primary Series</a> </span><sup class="level">(level 2)</sup> </div>
In these classes, the teacher offers detailed alignment cues and descriptions of the postures as s/he guides students through a partial primary series including the full series of sun salutations and standing postures and select sequences from the seated postures and the finishing sequence. These classes build off the foundations introduced in the Basics classes. (1 ½ hours)</li>

      <li class="ashtanga"><div><span class="ashtanga-title"><a id="lunch_hour_ashtanga">Lunch Hour Ashtanga</a> </span><sup class="level">(level 2)</sup></div>
These classes offer a shorter version of the partial primary series described above. The classes include the full series of sun salutations and select standing, seated and finishing postures. (1 hour)</li>

      <li class="ashtanga"><div><span class="ashtanga-title"><a id="ashtanga_primary_series_level3">Ashtanga Primary Series</a> </span><sup class="level">(level 3)</sup> </div>
In these classes, the teacher typically guides the students through the sun salutations and standing postures using the traditional Sanskrit counting. This allows students to cultivate a deeper meditative state and develop the internal qualities described in Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras. Each class includes the full opening and standing postures and full finishing sequence. The first half of the seated postures are practiced on Tuesdays and the second half of the seated postures are practices on Thursdays, allowing students to work with all of the postures each week. (1 ¾ hours)</li>

      <li class="ashtanga"><div><span class="ashtanga-title"><a id="ashtanga_secondary_series">Ashtanga Secondary Series</a> </span><sup class="level">(level 3)</sup></div>
  The second series develops out of the primary series and this class assumes both familiarity with the Ashtanga yoga system and basic comfort with the postures (or their modifications) from the primary series. These classes are also taught using the Sanskrit counting and terminology to help students deepen their practice. (1 ½ hours)</li>

<ul class="ashtangas">

  <li class="ashtanga"><div><span class="ashtanga-title"><a id="slow_flow_level1">Slow Flow</a> </span><sup class="level">(level 1)</sup></div>
In this beginners' class, we will apply the Anusara Yoga principles emphasizing healthy alignment (to protect our joints) and building muscle strength by holding postures longer and deeper. Students will also learn how to use the breath to still the mind as we slowly flow through the poses.</li>
  
  <li class="ashtanga"><div><span class="ashtanga-title"><a id="vinyasa_flow_mixed">Vinyasa Flow</a> </span><sup class="level">(mixed levels)</sup></div>
In this Vinyasa Flow class, students are guided through a modified Ashtanga form that also incorporates elements from Iyengar Yoga. Students are encouraged to practice with an awareness of breath, alignment and movement that combines purpose with grace. Over the long term, students may expect to benefit with improved strength, respiration, endurance, flexibility, balance, circulation, mental clarity, and an elevated sense of connectedness. Every class is designed to help students release the tensions of daily life and to progress on their personal path. </li>
  
<li class="ashtanga"><div><span class="ashtanga-title"><a id="vinyasa_flow_level2">Vinyasa Flow</a> </span><sup class="level">(level 2)</sup></div>
In this intermediate class, we will explore an energetic and playful series of postures moving through standing poses, arm balances, inversions, back bends and restorative poses. While the overall structure of the class will be consistent and balanced, the specific sequences and postures will vary somewhat from week to week. </li>

<li class="ashtanga"><div><span class="ashtanga-title"><a id="advanced_vinyasa_level3">Advanced Vinyasa</a> </span><sup class="level">(level 3)</sup></div>
In this well-rounded class, the teacher and students will ride through a strong practice together. The class aims to cultivate strength but more importantly intelligence in our bodies.

<p><font size=5><u><b><a id="qigong">Qigong:</a></b></u></font></p>
<p>Qigong is sometimes called “Chinese Yoga” and has been practiced in China for thousands of years.  Qigong is an internal meditative practice that uses gentle movements, breathing techniques, and self-massage.  Together, these strengthen the mind-body connection, reduce stress, increase vitality, and promote serenity.  </p>
<p><br></p>

<p>This class will focus on Bu Zheng Qigong and the Nine Phases of Qi.  These two methods work perfectly together.  Bu Zheng Qigong provides a solid foundation in the basics of Qigong:  meditation, massage, movement, and breathing.  The Nine Phases of Qi encourage students to go deeper into practice with a series of movements designed to connect with universal energy, clear blockages, and enhance Qi flow.  </p>
<p><br></p>

<p>Qigong is easy to learn and bring into your life on a daily basis. No experience necessary. All levels of fitness welcome. No strenuous or vigorous activity required.  Class can be done while seated.</p>

<p><font size=5><u><b><a id="yin_yoga">Yin Yoga:</a></b></u></font></p>
<p>Yin Yoga applies a deep and restorative approach to yoga asana practice. This class uses long, meditative holds to delve into the deep connective tissues of the body. It is designed to release stress throughout the body, creating structural and mental balance. This class is appropriate for all levels: it’s deep, releasing techniques will compliment more active forms of yoga and exercise and it’s slow, restorative pace will benefit students working with stiffness and mild injuries.  </p>
