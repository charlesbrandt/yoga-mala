<p><u><b>I HAVE NEVER DONE YOGA. HOW DO I KNOW WHICH CLASS IS BEST FOR ME TO START WITH?</b></u><br>
  Yoga has many different approaches that are tailored towards the different needs of different students. But all yoga offers students similar results which include a calming of the nervous system and the mind; release of physical tensions in the body and a path towards inner peace. <br>
  <br>
  Which approach is best for which student depends in large part on a student’s basic constitution and the current physical state of his/her body. The 4 classes we recommend for students new to yoga are listed here from least physically demanding to most physically demanding to help students decide which class will best suit them. Detailed descriptions can be found on our class descriptions pages. Please feel free to email or call us if you would like more personalized guidance. <br>

your energy.  That is all. Let the yoga do the rest.
